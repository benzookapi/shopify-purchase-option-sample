# How to run
1. Add the following environmental variables locally or in cloud platforms like Render / Heroku / Fly, etc.
```
SHOPIFY_API_KEY:              YOUR_API_KEY (Copy and paste from your app settings in partner dashboard)
SHOPIFY_API_SECRET:           YOUR_API_SECRET (Copy and paste from your app settings in partner dashboard)
SHOPIFY_API_VERSION:          unstable
SHOPIFY_API_SCOPES:           write_products,write_orders,read_customer_payment_methods,read_own_subscription_contracts,write_own_subscription_contracts

SHOPIFY_DB_TYPE:              MONGODB (Default) / POSTGRESQL / MYSQL

// The followings are required if you set SHOPIFY_DB_TYPE 'MONGODB'
SHOPIFY_MONGO_DB_NAME:        YOUR_DB_NAME (any name is OK)
SHOPIFY_MONGO_URL:            mongodb://YOUR_USER:YOUR_PASSWORD@YOUR_DOMAIN:YOUR_PORT/YOUR_DB_NAME

// The followings are required if you set SHOPIFY_DB_TYPE 'POSTGRESQL'
SHOPIFY_POSTGRESQL_URL:       postgres://YOUR_USER:YOUR_PASSWORD@YOUR_DOMAIN(:YOUR_PORT)/YOUR_DB_NAME

// The followings are required if you set SHOPIFY_DB_TYPE 'MYSQL'
SHOPIFY_MYSQL_HOST:           YOUR_DOMAIN
SHOPIFY_MYSQL_USER:           YOUR_USER
SHOPIFY_MYSQL_PASSWORD:       YOUR_PASSWORD
SHOPIFY_MYSQL_DATABASE:       YOUR_DB_NAME

```

2. Build and run the app server locally or in cloud platforms. All settings are described in `package.json` (note that the built React code contains `SHOPIFY_API_KEY` value from its envrionment variable, so if you run it with your own app, you have to run the build command below at least one time).
```
Build command = npm install && npm run build (= cd frontend && npm install && npm run build && rm -rf ../public && mv dist ../public && mv ../public/index.html ../views/index.html  *Replacing Koa view files with Vite buit code)

Start command = npm run start (= node app.js)
```

3. If you run locally, you need to ngrok tunnel for public URL as follows (otherwise, the command lines above are usable in Render or other cloud platform deploy scripts).
```
cd NGROK_DIR && ngrok http 3000
```

4. Set `YOUR_APP_URL` (your ngrok or other platform `root` URL) and `YOUR_APP_URL/callback` to your app settings in [partner dashboard](https://partners.shopify.com/). If you add `?external=true` parameter to `YOUR_APP_URL`, the app UX turns into a [service connector](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/899580/215689359-724b5000-cf86-4b6c-92bf-71b724632059.mp4) which tries to connect Shopify stores with their users. 

5. (For PostgreSQL or MySQL users only,) create the following table in your database (in `psql` or `mysql` command or other tools).
```
For PostgreSQL:

CREATE TABLE shops ( _id VARCHAR NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, data json NOT NULL, created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL, updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL );

For MySQL:

CREATE TABLE shops ( _id VARCHAR(500) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, data JSON NOT NULL, created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL, updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL );

```
6. For CLI generated extensions, execute `npm run deploy -- --reset` and follow its instruction (choose your partner account, connecting to the exising app, etc.) which registers extensions to your exising app and create `/.env` file which has extensiton ids used by this sample app. After the command ends  successfully, go to the created extension in your [partner dashboard](https://partners.shopify.com/) and enable its dev. preview if available (it's enough for testing in development stores). For [Shopify Functions](https://shopify.dev/api/functions) deployment using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), you need [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) Wasm package installed first by `cargo install cargo-wasi`.

7. For updating the extensions, execute `npm run deploy` (without `-- --reset`) to apply (upload) your local modified files to the created extensions (`-- --reset` is used for changing your targeted app only).

8. (For live stores only, you need to create a version of the extension and publish it. See [this step](https://shopify.dev/apps/deployment/extension).)


# How to install
Access to the following endpoit.
`https://SHOPIFY_SHOP_DOMAIN/admin/oauth/authorize?client_id=YOUR_API_KEY&scope=YOUR_API_SCOPES&redirect_uri=YOUR_APP_URL/callback&state=&grant_options[]=`ã€€

Or 

`you can install to your development stores from the app settings in partner dashboard.`

# Trouble shooting

- If you see the error page with the message like `"YOUR_APP_NAME is expired, this is an old app which no logner works after..."` during top page rendering in Shopify admin, check and fix the following major issues.
  - Do not use redirection to the old admin URL of "https://XXX.myshopify.com/admin". Use the new one of "https://admin.shopify.com/store/XXX", instead. Refer to the [migration document](https://shopify.dev/apps/tools/app-bridge/updating-overview#ensure-compatibility-with-the-new-shopify-admin-domain).
  - Your server needs to render the top page at acceptable speed in the right way. Too slow access, error HTTP codes, or server shutdown causes the error above in live stores (not in development ones). Some cloud plarform like Render, Heroku, etc do the very slow response for the first time in a while with free plans, so you need to swtich to ngrok hosting or pay those services for higher performence. 

# TIPS

- You can use the endpoint of `webhookgdpr` for [GDPR Webhooks](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/store/security/gdpr-webhooks).
- If you fail to get [protected customer data](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/store/data-protection/protected-customer-data) in Checkout UI Extension or API Webhook creation even in dev. stores, submit your app first which enable you get them.
