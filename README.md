# Overview
A Runnable Sample Subscrition app based on [Shopify developer document for subscription](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/selling-strategies/subscriptions/modeling). 


This app is cloned and modified from [this sample](https://github.com/benzookapi/shopify-barebone-app-sample).


# How to run
0. **You need to submit subscription API access request** from your app settings in [partner dashboard](https://partners.shopify.com/) (this doesn't need to be a public app, custom one is OK which makes you approved more easily).

1. Add the following environmental variables locally or in cloud platforms like Render / Heroku / Fly, etc.
```
SHOPIFY_API_KEY:              YOUR_API_KEY (Copy and paste from your app settings in partner dashboard)
SHOPIFY_API_SECRET:           YOUR_API_SECRET (Copy and paste from your app settings in partner dashboard)
SHOPIFY_API_VERSION:          unstable
SHOPIFY_API_SCOPES:           write_products,write_orders,read_customer_payment_methods,write_own_subscription_contracts,write_customers,write_assigned_fulfillment_orders,write_merchant_managed_fulfillment_orders,write_third_party_fulfillment_orders

SHOPIFY_CONTRACT_EXT_ID:      The value of 'SHOPIFY_MY_THEME_CONTRACT_EXT_ID' in '.env' which is generated by `npm run deploy` in step 6. described below

SHOPIFY_DB_TYPE:              MONGODB (Default) / POSTGRESQL / MYSQL

// The followings are required if you set SHOPIFY_DB_TYPE 'MONGODB'
SHOPIFY_MONGO_DB_NAME:        YOUR_DB_NAME (any name is OK)
SHOPIFY_MONGO_URL:            mongodb://YOUR_USER:YOUR_PASSWORD@YOUR_DOMAIN:YOUR_PORT/YOUR_DB_NAME

// The followings are required if you set SHOPIFY_DB_TYPE 'POSTGRESQL'
SHOPIFY_POSTGRESQL_URL:       postgres://YOUR_USER:YOUR_PASSWORD@YOUR_DOMAIN(:YOUR_PORT)/YOUR_DB_NAME

// The followings are required if you set SHOPIFY_DB_TYPE 'MYSQL'
SHOPIFY_MYSQL_HOST:           YOUR_DOMAIN
SHOPIFY_MYSQL_USER:           YOUR_USER
SHOPIFY_MYSQL_PASSWORD:       YOUR_PASSWORD
SHOPIFY_MYSQL_DATABASE:       YOUR_DB_NAME

```

2. Build and run the app server locally or in cloud platforms. All settings are described in `package.json` (note that the built React code contains `SHOPIFY_API_KEY` value from its envrionment variable, so if you run it with your own app, you have to run the build command below at least one time).
```
Build command = npm install && npm run build (= cd frontend && npm install && npm run build && rm -rf ../public/assets && mv dist/assets ../public/assets && mv dist/index.html ../views/index.html  *Replacing Koa index file with Vite buit code)

Start command = npm run start (= node app.js)
```

3. If you run locally, you need to cloudflare tunnel for public URL as follows (otherwise, the command lines above are usable in Render or other cloud platform deploy scripts).
```
cloudflared tunnel --url localhost:3000 
```

4. Set `YOUR_APP_URL` (your cloudflare or other platform `root` URL) and `YOUR_APP_URL/callback` to your app settings in [partner dashboard](https://partners.shopify.com/) and also **replace `const APP_URL=... in extensions/my-subscription-ext/src/index.jsx` with `YOUR_APP_URL` manually**.

5. (For PostgreSQL or MySQL users only,) create the following table in your database (in `psql` or `mysql` command or other tools).
```
For PostgreSQL:

CREATE TABLE shops ( _id VARCHAR NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, data json NOT NULL, created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL, updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL );

For MySQL:

CREATE TABLE shops ( _id VARCHAR(500) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, data JSON NOT NULL, created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL, updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL );

```

6. Turn **OFF** [Development store preview] in app extensions menu.

7. For CLI generated extensions, execute `npm run deploy -- --reset` and follow its instruction (choose your partner account, connecting to the exising app, etc.) which registers extensions to your exising app and create `/.env` file which has extensiton ids used by this sample app. After the command ends successfully.

8. For updating the extensions, execute `npm run deploy` (without `-- --reset`) to apply (upload) your local modified files to the created extensions (`-- --reset` is used for changing your targeted app only).

9. The customer portal (subscription my page) uses [Shopify App proxies](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/online-store/app-proxies) and you need to dispatch `YOUR_APP_SERVER_URL/appproxy` (Proxy URL) to `STORE_URL/apps/mysubpage` following [this step](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/online-store/app-proxies#add-an-app-proxy). Note that the app proxy doesn't accept ngrok bypass URL, so you need a real public endpoint hosted by servers (e.g. Heroku, Fly.io, Render, etc.) or cloudflare tunnel above.


# How to install
Access to the following endpoit.
`https://SHOPIFY_SHOP_DOMAIN/admin/oauth/authorize?client_id=YOUR_API_KEY&scope=YOUR_API_SCOPES&redirect_uri=YOUR_APP_URL/callback&state=&grant_options[]=`ã€€

Or 

`you can install to your development stores from the app settings in partner dashboard.`

# Trouble shooting
- If you have the error `NotBeforeError: jwt not active` in your cosole running locally (which happens when your serer code receives the session token from the UI extension like adding a selling plan), it is caused by [this reason](https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken#notbeforeerror) that the given [nbf](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.5) in the session token is past than your current timestamp. If you see this often, deploying your code to a hosted server will be better.

# TIPS
- [subscriptionBillingAttemptCreate](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/unstable/mutations/subscriptionBillingAttemptCreate) is **NOT** guaranteed to has the latest order in its response due to some time lag, and the best way of order fullfillment and billing error hanlding is querying the contract later in a batch process (this sameple uses a few second blocking as a synced wait which should not be applied to our live code...).
- You can use the endpoint of `webhookgdpr` for [GDPR Webhooks](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/store/security/gdpr-webhooks).
- If you fail to get [protected customer data](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/store/data-protection/protected-customer-data) in [subscriptionContract query](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/unstable/queries/subscriptionContract), apply the customer data request from your app settings in partner dashboard and submit your app first (the submission can be in-review, doesn't have to be completed for dev. store testing) which enable you get them.
